# Visual Object Tracking: The Initialisation Problem
Model initialisation is an important problem in object tracking. Tracking
algorithms are generally provided with the first frame of a sequence and a
bounding box indicating the location of the object. This bounding box may
contain of a large number of background pixels in addition to the object and
can lead to parts-based tracking algorithms initialising their object models
in background regions of the bounding box.

We tackled this as a missing labels problem, marking pixels sufficiently away
from the bounding box as belonging to the background and learning the labels
of the unknown pixels. We adapted three techniques to this problem; One-Class
SVM (OC-SVM), Sampled-Based Background Model (SBBM), a novel background model
based on pixels samples, and Learning Based Digital Matting (LBDM).

These were evaluated with leave-one-video-out cross-validation on images taken
from the [VOT2016](http://www.votchallenge.net/vot2016/) tracking benchmark.
Our evaluation showed both OC-SVMs and SBBMs are capable of providing a good
levels of segmentation accuracy but are too parameter-dependent to be used in
real-world scenarios. We showed that LBDM achieved significantly increased
performance with cross validation selected parameters and investigated its
robustness to parameter variation.

This repository contains the three Python 3.6 implementations of the techniques
(LBDM, SBBM, OC-SVM) used in the paper.

## Prerequisites
+ **All techniques**: matplotlib, numpy, scipy, skimage
+ **OC-SVM**: sklearn

## Usage
Information on each method can be found by typing ```help(function_name)```
at the python interpreter.

To see a working example of each of the three techniques, run their respective
python files:
